# React-project
I'm following this 12 hr tutorial with FreeCodeCamp to try and get a grasp on React. And the Command Line.
Ok...Slow is fast...I have installed node version 12.18.3 and checked npm is version 6.14.6...so I met these specs.
At some point I got the create react app command to work because I'm reading the ReadMe for it right in my repo so...
Now I have installed bootstrap with the npm install bootstrap command and am seeing all of my new json packages and licenses and info about react app.
I have initialized this as a git repository and have all files staged and commited as a git repo at /c/Projects/JavaScript-Projects/React-project (master)


...SEARCHING FOR PROPER WAY TO NOW PUSH ALL TO THIS GITHUB REPOSITORY.....I WISH MYSELF LUCK AND SEND PRAYERS TO ME LOL...BUT REALLY SELF YOU CAN LEARN THIS FINALLY!!!!

I am currently looking at this in my directory  ` /c/Projects/JavaScript-Projects/React-project (master)
 $ dir
index.html  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json


 /c/Projects/JavaScript-Projects/React-project (master)
 $ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
 `
 
 Looking to push to Github repo with the name of well THIS one ! jnutt367/React-project
Well, what a great last few hours and breakthroughs with git!!! The command line will become my bestie!!!
I am in love with the fact that I can now make changes to a github repo without ever coming here what a fabulous MILESTONE in my journey!!!
Wow!! I cant wait to see what possibilities this will open up and allow this React app to become something while I journey to learn React and the command line...and Hey 
This will be documenting the trek!!! Man I'm going somewhere!
